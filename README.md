## Features

The **Valorant Safe Cheat** offers a range of functionalities to cater to your needs:

### Undetected ESP
Gain a strategic advantage with our undetected Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) feature. This allows you to see enemy positions through walls and other obstacles. This feature is crucial for planning your next move and avoiding ambushes.

### Legit-Mode Aimbot
Improve your aim with a legit-mode aimbot. This feature helps you aim accurately without raising suspicion. It adjusts to your playstyle, making it appear natural to other players.

### Radar
Utilize a radar to track enemy movements. This feature gives you a broader view of the battlefield, helping you anticipate enemy actions and react accordingly.

### Bunnyhop
The bunnyhop feature allows you to move quickly and fluidly across the map. This can make you a harder target and improve your overall mobility during gameplay.

### Skinchanger
Customize your in-game appearance with the skinchanger feature. This allows you to change weapon skins without affecting gameplay performance.

### Silent Aim
The silent aim feature lets you hit targets without the usual visual cues. This can be particularly useful in high-stakes situations where stealth is crucial.

### Spinbot
For those who want to have a little fun, the spinbot feature can make your character spin rapidly, making it hard for enemies to hit you. Use this feature sparingly to avoid detection.

### Permanent Spoofer
The permanent spoofer feature helps mask your identity, allowing you to play without worrying about bans. This adds an extra layer of security to your gameplay.

### Temporary Spoofer
If you prefer a less permanent solution, the temporary spoofer can also help you play without detection. This is ideal for casual players who want to experiment without long-term consequences.
